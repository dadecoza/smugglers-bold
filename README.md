# SMUGGLERS BOLD

This is a rather daft ADVENTURE-type game which demands 16K ZX81, or ZX80 with new ROM. You can replace the PAUSE lines with FOR/NEXT loops if you want it to run more smoothly on a ZX81.

You are exploring a cave system in Penzance, with two companions of your choice, looking for treasure. An enormous number of obstacles stand in your way, but if you are brave, you will finally see the light of day.

## Tools
I have typed this basic program out on a modern computer and created the .P and .TZX files using the below tools.
* [ZXText2p](http://freestuff.grok.co.uk/zxtext2p/index.html) - an open-source command line utility that takes a text file containing a ZX81 BASIC program, and turns it into a ".P" file suitable for loading into your favourite ZX81 or TS1000 emulator.
* [zx81putil](https://github.com/mcleod-ideafix/zx81putil) - Read a .P file and convert it to a TZX tape image using 1.20 specification, ready to be played back to the ZX81.
* [JtyOne](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/jtyone.html) - Java based ZX81 emulator.
